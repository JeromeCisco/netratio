This simple app tells you how much of your wired network
is used.

This app relies on the great and only Cisco DNA Center.
You will need to provide all Cisco DNA Center details
(IP and credentials) in a configuration file. Modify and
rename "dnac_config.py.orig" file to "dnac_config.py".

This scripts leverage Cisco Devnet DNA Center Python library.
